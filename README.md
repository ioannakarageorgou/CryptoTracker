# Crypto Tracker App

This app was made by following a @SwiftfulThinking course on Youtube using Xcode 15.2 with Swift 5.9. It uses SwiftUI, MVVM Architecture, Combine and Core Data. The project benefits from multithreading, publishers/subscribers and data persistence.
The cryptocurrency data that is used in this app comes from a free API from CoinGecko!
